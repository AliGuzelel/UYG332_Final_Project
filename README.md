Project Description:
This project contains the solution to six image processing problems using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each problem involves tasks such as reading and displaying images, applying spatial and frequency domain transformations, noise removal, image enhancement, and statistical analysis.
This project demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques like unsharp masking, log transforms, inverse transforms, filtering, and noise analysis. Explanations are provided using Markdown cells, and all output images are displayed directly within the notebook.


Requirements
The notebook was developed and tested using:
- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cv2 (OpenCV)
- PIL
- scipy
